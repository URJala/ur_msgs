# An integer [1;3] specifying how the robot interprets the force frame
# 1: The force frame is transformed in a way such that its y-axis is aligned with a vector pointing
#    from the robot tcp towards the origin of the force frame.
# 2: The force frame is not transformed.
# 3: The force frame is transformed in a way such that its x-axis is the projection of the robot tcp
#     velocity vector onto the x-y plane of the force frame.

# Force mode damping factor. Sets the damping parameter in force mode. In range [0;1], default value is 0.025
# A value of 1 is full damping, so the robot will decelerate quickly if no force is present. A value of 0
# is no damping, here the robot will maintain the speed.

# Force mode gain scaling factor. Scales the gain in force mode. scaling parameter is in range [0;2], default is 0.5. 
# A value larger than 1 can make force mode unstable, e.g. in case of collisions or pushing against hard surfaces.
